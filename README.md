# MSLASSO
Multi-split LASSO algorithm

The Multi-split LASSO algorithm was implemented in Costa and Baker (2020) - Factors Influencing Business Recovery After The 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. It combines the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique, and the Multi-split Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Algorithm to fit sparse logistic regression models to imbalanced data.
